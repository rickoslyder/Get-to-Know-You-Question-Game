# A List of Interesting Questions for People to Get to Know Their Friends, Family, Lovers, Coworkers, Nemeses, and Selves Better

**Challenge:** create a Get To Know You game

Players: 2

Each person either chooses a number between 1-305, or has a question chosen for them (question bank reshuffles before each game).

The aim is to eventually use Kivy to create a mobile app.

Planned user flow:

* user opens app - welcome menu with START NOW at top & an Add Player dialog (two text fields, a + button and list of added players)
* remember previous player names and include in dialog box

(eventually add themes / intensity levels / ask if you're playing with family/friend/lover / time limit before game ends / max questions)

* start game with chosen theme etc
* question bank is reshuffled to ensure no overlap in question number across games
* "PLAYER's turn - pick a number between 1 and 305, or let me choose for you?"
* question is displayed on screen - implement TTS (speaker icon)
* "NEXT TURN" button underneath, share button
* Keep going until user quits / XX questions threshold / time limit

* You asked each other: "XX" questions - play again? new theme
